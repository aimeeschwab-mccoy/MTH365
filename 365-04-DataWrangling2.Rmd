## NYC flights

<div class="red2">__Example__:</div>

The R package `nycflights13` contains data about all flights that departed one of the three New York City airports (JFK, LGA, and EWR) in 2013. As you can probably imagine, this isn't a small dataset.

```{r}
# install.packages('nycflights13')
library(nycflights13)
data(flights)
```

## NYC flights

```{r}
names(flights)
```

## Data linkage

Suppose we want to know more about the airline (`carrier`). In the data set, each carrier is stored using a two-letter code.

```{r}
table(flights$carrier)
```

- Why use a two-letter code instead of the airline name?
- Can we _link_ the airline names to the letter codes?

## Data linkage

Use a common variable, called a _key_, to link the data.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/join_key.png")
```

## `inner_join()`

```{r}
data(airlines)

flights_carrier <- flights %>%
  inner_join(airlines, by=c('carrier'='carrier'))
```

## `inner_join()`

```{r}
names(flights_carrier)
```

## Departure delays on United

<div class="green2">__Extra practice__:</div>

1. Create a new data set, `flights2` that contains the carrier name, year, month, day, departure delay, arrival delay, origin airport, destination airport, and flight number.
2. How many unique flight routes does United Airlines run that depart the New York area?
3. How many unique destinations does United Airlines serve from the New York Area?
3. How many unique flight routes does United Airlines run from each of the three area airports?
4. What is the average departure delay of a United Airlines flight leaving any New York area airport?
5. What is the average departure delay of a United Airlines flight leaving JFK? LGA? EWR?

## Relative age effect

<div class="red2">__Example__:</div> 

The "Relative Age Effect" is an attempt to explain anomalies in the distribution of birth month among athletes. Briefly, the idea is that children born just after the age cut-off for participation will be as much as 11 months older than their fellow athletes, which is enough of a disparity to give them an advantage. This advantage gets cmpounded over the years, resulting in notably more professional athletes born in these months. 

Is there evidence of the relative age effect in professional baseball?

## Relative age effect

This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2016. It includes data from the two current leagues (American and National), the four other "major" leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.

```{r}
#install.packages('Lahman')
library(Lahman)
```

## Relative age effect

Let's start with pitchers.

```{r}
data(Pitching)
names(Pitching)
```

Check the documentation for the `Lahman` package. How could we get the birthdays of professional pitchers?

## Relative age effect

```{r}
data(Master)
names(Master)
pitcher_bday <- Pitching %>%
  inner_join(Master, by=c('playerID'='playerID'))
glimpse(pitcher_bday)

```

## Relative age effect

Let's simplify this data set to include only player ID and birth month.

```{r}
pitcher_bday <- pitcher_bday %>% select(c('playerID', 'birthMonth'))

pitcher_bday %>% group_by(birthMonth) %>% 
  summarize(N=n())
```

## Relative age effect

__Problem__: Are players unique?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pitcher_bday %>% arrange(playerID)
```

Run this code in your notes and see what happens. (Comment it out before you compile your document - trust me.)

## Relative age effect

```{r}
pitcher_bday %>% distinct() %>% 
  group_by(birthMonth) %>% 
  summarize(N=n())
```

## Relative age effect

```{r}
unique_bday <- pitcher_bday %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(birthMonth) %>% 
  summarize(N=n())
```

## Relative age effect

```{r}
ggplot(pitcher_bday, aes(x=birthMonth)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill=birthMonth))
```

## Relative age effect

```{r, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(pitcher_bday, aes(x=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  labs(x='Birth Month') +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option='viridis', discrete=TRUE)
```

## Relative age effect

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pitcher_bday %>% distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  labs(x='Birth Month') +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option='viridis', discrete=TRUE)
```

## Relative age effect

<div class="green2">__Extra Practice__:</div> 
Is there evidence of a relative age effect for batters? Hint: Use the `Lahman` package documentation to get started.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Lahman/Lahman.pdf

Use the `viridis` online documentation to choose a different color scale.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html

## Batting

```{r}
data(Batting)
batting_bday <- Batting %>%
  inner_join(Master, by=c('playerID'='playerID'))
glimpse(batting_bday)

unique_bday <- batting_bday %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(birthMonth) %>% 
  summarize(N=n())
unique_bday

batting_bday %>% distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  labs(x='Birth Month') +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option='viridis', discrete=TRUE)
```

## Fielding

```{r}
data(Fielding)
fielding_bday <- Fielding %>%
  inner_join(Master, by=c('playerID'='playerID'))
glimpse(fielding_bday)

unique_bday <- fielding_bday %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  group_by(birthMonth) %>% 
  summarize(N=n())
unique_bday

fielding_bday %>% distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  labs(x='Birth Month') +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option='viridis', discrete=TRUE)

unique_bday %>% distinct() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=as.factor(birthMonth))) +
  labs(x='Birth Month') +
  theme(legend.position="none") + 
  scale_fill_viridis(option='viridis', discrete=TRUE)
